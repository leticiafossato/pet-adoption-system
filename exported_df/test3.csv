She's such a charmer that the regulars have been feeding her..Lately, she has been spotting wounds on her body. It has got worst so we decided to take her to Dr Gills for treatment. She has been there for a week and is doing fantastic. Her wounds are healing and drying up and she has been vaccinated. She might have to stay there for another 2 weeks before she can go home. We have decided not to take her back to Botanical Gardens as we have grown very attached to her and do not want her to go back to her old condition. She likes to go hiking with the regulars so it's possible for her to injure herself again - as such she has already lost her new dog collar & licence that somebody got her. Unfortunately, we already have three dogs of which two are rescue dogs also so can't take her in. Therefore, we need to find a loving HOME for her. Goldie is already an adult female - we don't know how old. She has a lovely brown coat with eyes that will melt your heart. She's very very calm and of good temperament. In all the time we've known her, she has never barked and would happily come when called. She also loves dry dog food. We've taken a couple of pictures of her - which is very difficult as she's always chasing imaginary flies - she's so used to keeping flies off her back ! - Can some KIND SOUL out there please make room in your HOME for this lovely dog who will love you unconditionally. The vet bills are fully paid for so all you need is just to take her home. Her spaying fee will be paid for by the rescuers. Please call us if you are interested and we'll introduce you to GOLDIE..

His injury was causing him great pain and we can only assume that his owner abandoned him to avoid costly vet bills. We managed to gain his trust and took him to the vet for treatment. Sadly the vet diagnosed that the injury was too bad to save the leg and amputation was the best option. The newly named ""Nolan"" went through the operation and recovered amazingly well, in fact the vet told us that after such a major operation he was suprised at how well Nolan has recovered and how healthy he is. Nolan is really happy now that the pain has gone and is very lively and acts and behaves as if 3 legs are better than 4! He tries to show that he can do anything a 4 legged dog can do and do it better! He loves his walks and obviously misses human company as he is always asking for strokes and hugs and giving back kisses and licks. He has gone through an awful lot in his life and after going through so much pain and heartache after being injured and abandoned he really deserves a loving and secure home to live in.

The humans have many other nicknames for me, you will find out when you get the chance to meet me. :) My owner passed away, and his family could not keep me anymore. I used to produce many puppies for my owner, and my nipples are proof of that. The humans who took me in now said they only add on to my character. Yes, the nipples are a reminder of my past, but who doesn’t have a past right? The humans tell me I never need to produce puppies anymore. Phew, what a relief! Who can resist me, anyway? Just look at my face! Everyone I’ve met only has compliments for me. They always tell me I am the prettiest thing. I love belly rubs! Sometimes I give myself belly rubs by doing a belly dance. The humans said I am the cutest belly dancer. I also love attention and to be near humans. I love my food, of course! Although the humans said I do not have any problem with my skin, I still get the appropriate food as you just never know as we pugs can easily have skin issues. I love my fellow pugs in this house and also the bigger dogs. I’ve never had a problem learning where to do my business.

He was fearful but hunger got the best of him and he bravely came near us for a bit of my husband's pie. There was a Jaya Grocer nearby so I dashed there and bought 2 pouches of cat food. While he was gobbling up the first packet, my husband ask ""So are you going to catch it and get it snipped? Better decide now before it gets full and runs off."" Typically, I don't rescue cats who are not in need of help (i.e. not injured) and I trap-neuter-release stray cats whom I've fed for a while and am familiar with. But Chester seemed manageable to catch so I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and took him back to our place. ~Vet Visit - 27 Feb ~ Took Chester to the vet today, with the intention of getting him neutered. At the beginning, I'd thought Chester was female (I didn't get to check him out closely) so the vet enlightened me and informed me that he's male :P And for male cats, it is not recommended to neuter them too early so that their urinary tubes can develop so that they have a lesser chance of getting urinary issues later in life. The vet recommends male cats to be neutered around 10 months or older. This is a new thing I learned today because I'd thought all cats can be neutered from 6 months and above. Well, it can be done, just not recommended. (Note: The urinary issue does not affect female cats) Chester is estimated to be about 5 months old now. Unfortunately, I can't keep him for another 5 months before getting him neutered. So I am boarding him at the vet for the next 2 weeks to try to find him a home, failing which, I will neuter him and release him. Chester is not an aggressive cat. He is fearful of strangers and hisses, which is totally normal, but he does not bite or scratch. Once you softly pat his head, he calms down and stops hissing. Conditions for adoption: 1. Ideally to be an indoor-only cat. This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals. 2. Commit to neuter him at 10 months. Those who are interested to adopt Chester MUST commit to neuter him because this is the only way to control our stray cat population. It also prevents him from spraying around your house and prevents certain health conditions (Google on benefits of neutering cats). 3. Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on his progress until he is neutered. Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to Chester's adoption: De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. Serious adopters only.

When the waiter returned, we asked him about Hiro. Apparently Hiro liked to hang out at the restaurant and for obvious reasons, they didn't want him on the premises. Less than 5 mins after the waiter had taken Hiro away, he came back! This time the waiter took him to the back of the restaurant, which was where I found him, fast asleep on the concrete block housing the aircon compressor. I typically do not rescue cats in situations like this because (1) the cat was not injured; and (2) the cat was not in any immediate danger. But I could see that Hiro is quite friendly, from the way the waiter was handling him so I thought I'd try to find him a home. So home he came with us that day :-) We didn't have a box/carrier to put him in, so we just transported him in the car. He was quite perplexed but he didn't go berserk, like how a typical stray would be. Hiro is now at my vet getting the necessary done: deflea, deworm, vaccination, neuter. Once all these are done (in about 2-3 weeks), he will be ready for his new home! The only condition for Hiro's adoption is that he be kept indoors-only so that he won't run the risk of getting hit by vehicles and it prevents him from getting into altercations with other animals or open to abuse by humans. Updates from his adopter once in a while would be greatly appreciated so that I know he's doing fine :-) Hiro is currently being boarded at my vet in Puchong. I will send him to his new home within KL/Selangor. Serious adopters only. Kindly contact me via email, SMS or whatsapp if you are interested. I will contact you as soon as I can.

He had a rough start, with breathing difficulties that had him hospitalized for about a week and also malnourished. He didn't have energy to be the typical hyper kitten when he was first rescued. Now, he's full of energy and waiting for his forever home! Are you the one to be his forever family? Conditions for Brownie's adoption: 1. To be kept indoors-only so that he won't encounter the same situation as he was in when he was first rescued. Also, it prevents him from getting into altercations with other animals or open to abuse by humans. 2. To be neutered when he is of age. This is MANDATORY so that he doesn't add to the stray overpopulation. A RM neuter deposit will be collected from adopter, refundable upon proof of receipt of his neutering from your vet of choice. [Note: I have put in place this condition for all the kittens I have previously rescued and rehomed, and I am very thankful to note that their new guardians have all complied and refunds have been made to them as per the condition] 3. I will get his vaccination done but kittens need 3 initial doses. Depending on when he finds his forever home, if he has not completed the 3 doses, the adopter is to bring him for his subsequent dose(s) to complete it. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on his progress until he is neutered. [Note: Regular being once every few weeks; not daily or weekly unless the adopter wishes to do so] Brownie is currently being boarded at my vet in Puchong. I will send him to his new home within KL/Selangor. I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. Serious adopters only.

Putting her back on the streets would likely be an early death sentence for her 😞 She gets along very well with people, possibly could be an abandoned/lost cat. At the moment, she doesn't like other cats but it could be due to her having to defend herself to survive so she's currently constantly in fight mode. Horlicks has been spayed, deflead, dewormed and vaccinated. Prefer to be an only cat household, or someone who has the time and patience to integrate her with existing cats.

Horlicks is located in KL; I can send her to her new home within KL/PJ/Subang/Shah Alam/Klang.

The residents' committee rejected my proposal to implement Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM) to manage the stray cat population at our condo, and opted instead to engage DBKL to catch them. Working against time, I have trapped and neutered 4 cats, and released them in a nearby kampung with the permission and assistance of the kind gardener at my condo, because we all know what will happen to stray animals when DBKL or other municipal councils get them. Lucy is the 5th cat among those that I've caught and I boarded her at my vet so that she can safely deliver her babies (she was in her late pregnancy when I caught her). Lucy delivered 3 furballs on 18 Oct . They are about 3 weeks old now, 2 light grey ones and a dark grey tabby. Their genders can't be determined yet because they are still so young but do check this space, I will update as soon as we can tell. Lucy will be spayed once her kittens are weaned and she will be up for adoption thereafter. Lucy has a very calm temperament and she's quite docile, so much so that I managed to catch her with no trouble at all. When at the vet for the first time, she was very calm and allowed the vet to examine her without any trouble. I believe she will make a loving pet. I am estimating that she will be ready for adoption around mid-Dec . Lucy's kittens will be up for adoption once they are weaned and gotten their first dose of vaccination, which will be in another estimated 3 weeks. Lucy and her kittens can be adopted individually or together. They are currently boarded at my vet's clinic in Puchong and I can deliver them to their new home within Klang Valley. Conditions for adoption: 1. To be indoor-only cats. This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals. 2. Kittens to be spayed/neutered when they are 5-6 months. Those who are interested to adopt the kittens MUST commit to spaying or neutering them when they reach minimum age because this is the only way to control our stray cat population. There will be a RM deposit required for each kitten, which will be refunded upon proof of spaying/neutering. 3. Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 4. To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress during the first 3 months or until they are spayed/neutered. Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to their adoption: *Lucy: de-flea, deworm, spay and vaccinate *Kittens: de-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population.

Next up is getting them vaccinated and corresponding quarantine period to ensure they're not harbouring any hidden illnesses. They're so far active and healthy, with good appetites. My vet says they are in too good condition to be strays, hence a stronger suspicion that they may have been abandoned. I'm still trying to find them a home where they can be together because they are so attached to each other (we suspect they're siblings), although I am not closed to the idea of getting them adopted separately if really need be. Please do consider adopting them together and give them a second chance at having a family. Adoption conditions: 1. Love them and respect them as you would treat any other person (treat them like how you would like to be treated), provide them access to clean water, healthy food, medical treatments and most of all, give them love and attention. 2. A meet-up between potential adopter and the dogs would be recommended so both can meet each other and see if there's chemistry. 3. Allow occasional visitations so I may see how the adopter and dogs are doing. This will only be once in a while as I respect your privacy. An adoption fee would apply to cover some of their medical expenses. ~Original Post~ I very recently spotted Fred and Ginger near my parents' place. They were not there before, so they must have only just been dumped. Why I suspect that they're dumped pets? They display the following characteristics: 1. They have been in the same spot, out in the open, looking like they're waiting for their owner to return for them. Based on my observation of typical strays, they don't like to be out in the open and prefer to hide, coming out only when they need to look for food. 2. They are friendly; they came right up to me when I got down from my car. Again, looking like they were expecting their owner to come pick them up and take them home. They let me pet them and did not shy away from me at all. Typical strays would just run away when I even step out of my car and will only touch the food after I have driven off. The area where they are at is not safe for them because the people there may call the local council to catch them anytime because they are not stray-friendly at all. And given that Fred and Ginger stay out in the open, they make their presence known because people can see them whenever they pass by. I don't know how old they are, I am just guesstimating that they're around 1-2 years old. Please note that they are NOT purebred German Shepherds but they look like they have some mix of GS in them. They are medium sized, with somewhat short legs (reminds me of basset hounds). Put these features together and you get awesomely cute mixed breeds! I am willing to get them neutered, spayed and vaccinated before they go to their new homes. That is what the adoption fee will go towards. Please find it in your heart to give them a second chance at a home. They've already been dumped once (I suspect); please give them a second chance. If possible, do adopt them together because they are such a lovely couple! (see photo) They don't have much time; I would like to get them off the streets as soon as possible before the people call the local council on them. But I can't do it without securing a home for them first because I cannot afford long-term boarding for them. Please contact me at if you're interested. Genuine adopters only. Thank you.

However Henry has grown to be slightly bigger than what we expected and most importantly, we are both working adults with little time to play and exercise with him. Henry is toilet-trained (live indoor), very healthy, knows a fair amount of basic commands, and loves a good human companion. He needs a loving home and someone that has patience for him. He is absolutely gorgeous, already de-sexed and ready to go. This is an unfortunate decision for us to make, however we believe he could have a better life than his current. With few conditions, we wish to have updates on him once in a while just to see if he is doing well, and anyone considering chaining him up or putting him in cage is not ideal candidate.

At that moment of time the cat was still as lively as ever, seemingly ignorant of its injuries. However last wednesday I found the cat lying weak and limping from a seemingly broken paw, although its wounds were beginning to heal slightly. From accounts of some students, some have witnessed the cat being victim to dog attacks. My friend and I got it to the vet in Semenyih, but unfortunately it was closed. We applied iodine onto its wounds, and I kept it in my room for a few days.I took it back home to PJ in the weekends, and sought help. From diagnosis, the cat was probably ran over more than once by vehicles judging from its injuries, and the fracture is more severe than initially thought of. The cat has fractured/dislocated its shoulder, and it has begin to ossify, which means the bone is beginning to heal in an abnormal position. The cat will be lame for the rest of its life if not corrected, and this will render it defenseless as it hinders its movement (it can only hop now, and tends to lose balance and fall). The bone is now jutting out from the side. The vet recommended surgery as its nerve endings are still intact, in which a pin will be placed in the shoulder to help correct it. However, whether the cat will be able to use the leg after surgery will depend on the impact of the surgery on its nerves. If the surgery is performed after the bone heals in that abnormal position, the bone will have to be broken again to insert the pin. The surgery costs more a thousand ringgit. The vet says if surgery is decided against the cat has to be kept indoors as it is unable to protect itself or hunt for food. I am unable to pay for its medical cost due to financial problems. I have been taking care of the cat in my room. I cannot bring the cat back to my house because my dad has suppressed immunity as a result of chemotherapy, and I am beginning to wheeze as I keep the cat in such a confined space. I have brought the cat to PAWS, the most lenient of all animal shelters to see if they can rehome the cat, but according to policy if the cat has a broken leg it will be promptly put to sleep. I hope the students can help the cat out by: 1. Contributing a little to its medical fees 2. Adopt the cat, or at least look after it. The cat is clean, sensible, uses the cat litter well, very sociable and is not hostile towards other cats. It is pretty vocal and clingy though. I really need your help. The photo is a misrepresentation of its injuries, we mistakenly bandaged the paw thinking the paw is fractured. It also hides all its flesh wounds from view.

Vet told us he is unlikely to walk after crashed by a great hit. We hospitalized him for a few days. Vet suggested to put him to sleep as he showed no sign of walking. We as the rescuer never think of giving up him. We tried another 2 vets, same results we got. We decided to let it have a try on the animal acupuncture as recommeded by 1 of the vet. Sooner or later, we found Goldy started to get up and move little by little. We know there is hope for him. We go through a few treatments on him, and he walks now. Although there is still minor effect on the leg but he can even run now. He is a strong dog, he went through all the circumstances, he stand to be strong, a brave boy who struggled to live his life. Now, he is up for adoption, he looked like golden mix breed and he is hoping to be rehome by some kind soul who willing to give him a second chance in his tragic life.

It was a muracle that i managed to rescued them (3 siblings) after being trapped for 4 days. I called bomba & spca but as the hole was too small, they couldn't come for the rescue. Anyways, Alhamdullilah thank God they are safe. She is a cutie with beautiful stripes. She is bow legged and walks like a cowgirl (hihihi). Small size but fat. Scared of other humans but very affectionate (manja) to me. She is most of the time indoor but she does have a few hours outdoor. She always comes home when i call out ""mamam"" meaning makan or eat (typical cat). She is also a runner. When i open the door she will dash out like lightning but as she grows up here, she knows the neighborhood and will always find her way home. She is potty trained.

Either way, the previous owners must have been real losers and may God have mercy on them. I've grown so fond of Forest in the past few weeks that I've cared for him. He is now vaccinated and dewormed. Sadly, he still lives outside as a stray as my parents would not allow another dog in the house. Forest lives outside my gate in a flimsy ""house"" of umbrellas. He gets wet each time it rains and my heart prays and cries for him each time. I am in the midst of looking for a place of my own but it will take another 3-6 months.

The vet suspected it may be pheumonia or hernia and treatment was given immediately. She responded well to the treatment but further check up(ultrasound)is required in order to get back her health. Reason for giving her up for adoption is because she doesn't seems happy staying in my house as I have another dog that constantly stressing her out and she lost her freedom. I have no choice but to keep her in my room for her sake while I out for work. It's an urgent adoption because I have no heart to leave her on the street again and risk her life getting pregnant which would lead to her death.

He has got a big round eye and very lovely. One t&c is that he should get neutered by the age of 6 months to prevent more abandon cases. Neutering a pet comes with a lot benefits. One of it is that they will never establish spraying habit. Your furniture would keep clean throughout your life. Urgent adoption needed as I do not have sufficient cages to keep him, I have other abandoned cats and kitten to take care of. Thank you.",1f6fb5fdb,4.0,0,1f6fb5fdb-4

He was doing fine until he got run over by vehicles while approaching his feeder for food in a local wet market. By the time I found him with a limping right front leg and it's too late for any therapy to get its senses back. Amputation was done to avoid complication later which may lead to his dead. He was being neutered at the same time. I have kept him under my custody ever since. Adopter requirement: Free roaming indoor only with cat-proved environment Good food & love A forever home for him Never abandon him when he gets old or sick Give him the neccessary vaccinations when you can afford Fees charged are to allow me to neuter more strays like him to control the population. I have spent more than on him and I only ask for to neuter another cat. Hope you would understand. Reason to let go He is not going along well with one of my rescued cat who has pelvic fractured. I couldn't stand watching them getting hurt again. He is no different from any normal cat as he would jump and run and asking to be pet! The most manja cat ever. Contact me for more info.

So here I am asking your kindness to adopt this little cute fella as living in the wet market in his age is not safe at all. High traffic and human abuse happened everyday here and I noticed there are many cats being dumped here and left to death. Plz give him a good home and be sure to neuter him at the right age. I will need you to swear to god that you will do so to avoid more innocent life coming to this world and suffer. There are enough strays out there.

The other has screws in it. Still recovering, so she cannot be allowed to move too much. Tie with leash or place in playpen. Currently fighting distemper.

I wouldn't have known there's a puppy if she didn't stuck out her head and gave a little yelp. There's no collar on her. I brought her to the vet and was informed that she's only about 8 to 9 weeks then. She was really bloated as well with a little flu, so the vet prescribed her with some antibiotics and gave DMG as well as some vits. She just received her first jab last month after full recovery. Sookie knows how to pee and poo on newspaper, but not consistent enough (that's because she's lacking training, which is entirely my fault). She has separation anxiety; would jump on me when i return from work but it has been toned down a lot. She loves to sleep in the same room as me and loves a good run. She loves chewbones and ball; understand ""sit"" and ""no"" and ""down"". She's a smart pup; with patience and time, she could be quite easy to train. I'm looking for someone who has experience and wanted to keep a dog permanently. I would love to keep her but I already have two aging cats and they are quite upset with a new addition into the family. Besides,there's no one at home who could care for her while i'm away for work. Here are some conditions (to ensure that she finds a good home):- 1) Someone at home to care for her at all times. She must't be left alone for too long. 2) Someone who lives in a terrace (preferably) or willing to bring her to a garden. She loves a good run. 3) Ensure that she is spay and does not breed. 4) Would not mind if I keep in touch with the new owner for Sookie's update.

I suspect she is an abandoned pet as she is well socialised and a placid cat. She came into care with her 2 kittens who are very small despite their age. She is ready to leave the now and go to her forever home. She has started flea treatment-although we found no fleas. She enjoys sitting in the sun and looking at her kittens from a high distance. She still cleans them and puts up with them playing with her tail. According to the vets the kittens are over 3 months old. I took BB in as an emergency as other cat lovers were frightened of her or or kittens being run over in a busy car park that they were living in. I cannot continue to Care for BB as all my family are allergic to cats/dogs. I am hoping to rehome to a forever home for BB and the kittens. As the kittens might have to be Neutered/spayed before trehoming it might be a little longer before they are ready. I don't want to have to release BB back to the shop houses as I still worry about her safety-but I do have to think about the long term health of my family. BB deserves to find her forever home.

She is just a baby that time and her right eye seriously injured. Her mom and they all seems like feel safety downstair our hostel, so we start feeding and playing with them everyday. We tried to play with her but she seems afraid of human. So, that time she always hide behind her mother or sisters (her sisters play with us). One night (bout one week after we found them), we’re back from dinner and try to look for them but I heard from people work around here that her sister dead in the car accident. =( [we just play with her before go out for dinner] We were in a shock and sadness after we get the news. Few days after, as usual morning we go down to feed them and we only found miao miao and we couldn’t see miao’s mother anymore. As the days pass by, she grew elder and gain weight. The workers of shops all around know and like her very much. They always help us to find miao when she’s playing out of our sight. Since she grew elder and mature age, she will attract male cat to “sexual harass” her. We tried to get her unable to give birth by wanted to have the operation but she caught a cold and she cannot get her operation in such condition. While worry she will be pregnant under male cat’s attack when we’re away, we decided to bring her up to our hostel. We bath her until snow white first then prepare the sand for her. She seems a little bit not used to the hostel at first caused she used to run everywhere at downstair =) Til another day we bring her to vet for check up, the Vet told us that she is already pregnant!! Another shocking news for us, the Vet ask us whether we want to give her a check on leukemia and AIDS caused it can affect the baby cat of miao miao. After our consideration, we decided to run that test. Thank god! She don’t have AIDS but with Leukemia which will caused her immune system weaker than normal cat. Since this will pass to the baby cat, and we decided not to let few cats to suffer like her mom anymore we asked doctor to take the baby away from her and make her unable to be pregnant again. The Vet told us that it carry certain risk as miao has leukemia. That day, miao stay in the clinic and has her operation on the next day. Again, thank god ~miao is safe and the operation is very successful. But now, we faced problem from hostel management and also pressure from parent and have to let it go from us. Is anyone out there willing to give her your love and care? Please help her~ She need a home =( Who wanted to see her picture can add anggel. in facebook~ Thanks~~~",79773f498,4.0,0,79773f498-4

You can see from the pictures the before and after. He's quite ugly now but once the thick long fur grows back, he'll be beautiful again. Axl is a very loving creature. He's is a bit clingy.

After awhile I grew very fond of him because he's such a doll and I felt sorry for him for not having a home of his own. He's generally a good cat. Very affectionate and likes to be around people. He'll come running when you call his name. I think he would make a fabulous pet and companion. He is able to co-exist with my female cats without much fuss. The reason why I need to find a new home for him is because he doesn't get along with my male cat. I recently castrated him (my cat) and now Soya bullies him. He is very lovable and loves to be petted. He's not a fussy eater either and makes a good outdoor cat as well as an indoor cat. If you're interested please let me know. But I only want a responsible animal lover and not a so-so owner for him. I need to know that he'll be well cared for and not neglected later on. Edit: Although I think he would do fine indoors but I would like him to have a home where he is allowed access to the outside world. Preferably with a lawn. I have also added some more pictures of him so you can have a better idea of how he looks like. Edit2: The person who decided to take him changed her mind. Soya is still up for adoption. If you feel you can give him a good life please email me or sms me asap. Thank you.,58897f560,6.0,0,58897f560-6

I was outside with my cats, just enjoying the afternoon air. I saw him peeking from outside the gate at my cat Angie. Then he saw my foster kittens running around. He jumped inside. He looked harmless and so I let him be. I didn't think he would stick around but I was wrong. He is so very tame and affectionate which causes me to believe that he is someone's cat. But he was so skinny so I suspected that he was lost. The odd thing was that he looked at me like he knew who I was but I have never seen him around before. He even went about approaching my cats like he was family and was none too shy to attempt play with the kittens. It appears to be that he came from a multiple cat household/family. He stayed for 2 days and wouldnt leave. Fearing that someone might be looking for it, my mom and I decided to place him at this one area where we believed he might have originated from (considering several factors) in hopes that he would find his way home. Surprisingly, after a day he found his way back to my house! This prompted me to think that he may have ran away instead of gotten lost because he had found his way back to my place (I took him to that other area by car and at night so he couldn't have known the route- or so I thought). I surely hope that he wasn't abandoned by his previous owner and that is why he refuses to go home. I tried looking around for his owner but nobody seems to know where he came from. He's a very dear and loving cat. Likes to brush against people's legs and is obviously familiar with humans and other pet cats. He's not stunningly beautiful but he's got a soft friendly face and a BIG nose! =p. C'mon, Barbara Streisand has a huge nose and she's adored by many! Since no one has come forward to claim him and he wants to be someone's furkid, I've decided to put him up for adoption to anyone willing to give him a loving home. Unfortunately I cannot keep/foster him myself because I have reached full capacity for cats at my home for the time being. So I do not have the space nor the means to care for him. Adoption fees are for precautionary measures to make sure he doesn't get any joy/irresponsible adopters. He will be vaccinated and dewormed with that money. Strictly for animal lovers only who believe in the act of neutering. IF I can find donations to neuter him first I will do that before he goes to a new home. If not, you must promise to neuter him. He MUST be a FREE ROAMING cat either indoor, outdoor or both. I do not agree in caging animals unless for safety purposes or temporary health issues so if you plan to keep him in a cage 24/7, I'm sorry I will have to say no. Please understand that I will ask questions to see if you are suitable for the cat. It is not that I want to be unreasonable or difficult but I want what is best for the cat. Those interested please contact me preferably through email. Better yet, if this is your cat or you know the owner of this cat please let me know. Hopefully with sound proof that he belongs to you or that someone you know. Thank you.",04d2ba57a,4.0,1,04d2ba57a-4

She has already gotten her first vaccination. Subsequent vaccinations would be free provided she is brought, together with her pet vaccination certificate, to JR Veterinary Centre in Ipoh Garden South, Ipoh. She is a playful (but then, all puppies are playful) and loving puppy. An energetic and alert little bundle of fur. She is a clever little thing too. Unless, it is the middle of the night and everyone is sleeping or it is raining heavily, she would cry to be let out whenever she wants to poo or pee (already toilet trained by Mother Nature). She is on solids as the vet has given the go ahead to put Hazel on a solid diet. As you can see from the photos, Hazel has beautiful big round eyes that looked like they have been lined with black eye liner by Mother Nature. I would actually like to keep her but I have to take into account the interests of the people around me, so..... And I do not want to turn her out into the streets again. Seems such a cruel thing to do. (.)Today, we started teaching Hazel some basic instructions. Happy to say that she can easily understand simple instructions like ""come"", ""sit"" and ""shake hand"". Obedient when she is not in her playful mood. We also discovered that Hazel loves anything that is pink in colour. She also likes to rub herself against a person's legs like a cat. (.) Today, Hazel barked at a stranger for the first time instead of running to hide like she did previously. (.) Today, a very nice young man came to take Hazel home.

Meera is quiet and timid cat. Once she is comfortable with you, she is affectionate, but she is shy around strangers. She would be best suited to a single or a couple. However, as part of her foster journey (she has stayed with some friends when we have had to travel) she was looked after by a family with two children - though they are quiet and gentle kids, not noisy. We don't keep her in a cage and she has not destroyed any of our belongings. We really love her and want to find her a kind and loving forever home. We would love to keep her ourselves, but are leaving KL soon and feel like she would not do well in quarantine for 2 months. She would be best in a stable home, with a routine.

So this 'young' ciku is looking for love again. He deserves a good home after all he has been through. _______________________________________________ This old boy was abandoned in SPCA. Most likely due to his age. Thorough blood test (including heartworm) were done by private vet. He's certified healthy & in fact he doesn't look like 10 (must be the botox ;-)) The only tell tale sign is he has a few teeth left. He has been given an annual jab for heartworm and I'll get him vaccinated & neutered as well. What I know about this fella - * excellent temperament * good with kids especially young ones * still playful * has a 'territory marking' problem (can be fixed with lotsa of love and patience) * not toilet trained (again can be taught through consistent routine) I am hoping that someone with a big heart can take him in and let him feel loved again. It's not easy for an old dog to get a second chance. In fact his chance would have run out if I didn't take him out of SPCA & foster him. That special someone ideally should have some experience with dogs bcoz points 4 & 5. Most importantly he/she should stick with / by him through thick & thin.

He is very SOCIABLE and LOVING and will snuggle up to rest on your lap if you let him. Apart from his recovering burns, he is healthy and as inquisitive as kittens his age are wont to be. Already house-trained, he will make an ideal pet for FIRST-TIMER cat owners, or owners with several cats, having been ""additionally trained"" by the owner's other 3 cats.",68e1a0e38,8.0,0,68e1a0e38-8

It was contentedly chasing bugs and playing among the litter. I brought it home to observe for a couple of days, hoping for the mother cat to appear (no such luck). Perseveringly charming and 'humble' to the others, he has managed to win the trust of my other 3 cats in 2 weeks. It is Teddy's modus operandi to go up to a stretched-out cat on the floor and snuggle up to pseudo-nurse. Even though all my other cats have been neutered, I think instinct kicks-in upon this nursing action to calm the nerves of all concerned. So Teddy now has 3 pseudo-moms who will groom him and allow him to snuggle up to them! Monti, my oldest male cat, plays the part of big brother (sometimes mother!) and seems to be the most tolerant of Teddy, allowing him a wide measure of freedom for mischief. Unfortunately, I can't keep Teddy permanently due to space constraints and I worry that 4 full-grown cats under one roof may be a little too much to ask of my feline friends. All signs indicate that Teddy is very accommodating and may be quite partial to sharing living space with other cats (subject to the normal feline introduction procedures, of course)",963661d40,17.0,0,963661d40-17

He is a very loving and friendly house dog who is looking for a wonderful new family to adopt him for absolutely no fees required. Tykes is a good looking friendly rescued dog who grew up with many cat friends and other dogs. He enjoys cat food as he prefers the taste of fish over meat. Tykes doesn’t bite. His favourite game is tug-of-war and he loves chasing his tail. Tykes is a very happy dog who will greet you with an abundance of excitement when you return home. He loves going for walks or a run if you’re looking for a jogging companion. He loves being around people so he’s a great dog to keep as company. He is very communicative and will tell you if he needs to go to the bathroom, if he’s hungry or if somebody is outside the house. He is very wary of strange motorbikes and is very alert to even the smallest noise, so he makes a very good watch dog. He is a dog with many funny traits and will be there to love and brighten even your dullest day. All he needs is a new owner that is happy to shower him with abundance of love and promises to feed him his favourite food, he will be your best friend forever.

From the way she behaves, it seems like she used to have an owner.. so she is either lost or abandoned.

Mom believes his owner abandoned him there (or he lost his way home) as he just sat on the puddle looking extremely sad as if waiting for someone.

The owner of the puppy disowned a litter of puppies because they couldn't afford them though the puppy comes from a wealthy family which I think its mother comes from a good breed. My dog is around 3 months old right now, still growing and I need to find him a new owner ASAP. This is because the puppy had began to lose some fur and it now has a minor skin infection, but my father wouldn't take it to the veterinary because he thinks that this is a waste of money.If you were to ask me, my pup has got a beautiful sets of teeth and paws, he's actually cute cute himself. The puppy itself is actually very cute and quite energetic for people out there who loves to be around outdoor. The reason for me to post this ad is because I'm a uni student currently having my sem break and I'm afraid that my Dad might abandon the dog somewhere near the factories or worse at the construction company that he is working in. The environment near the construction itself is worse, and the Vietnamese and Myanmar foreign workers have been known to slaughter stray dogs including those around the construction sites for protein as they couldn't afford any meat. Puppies like these will be killed for their meats. I have no doubts of this. I'm seriously hoping to look for a new owner for this pup before my new semester kick starts. To be honest I don't think that my puppy's skin infection is serious, as I believe it can be dealt with if the puppy have medical attention. The puppy itself is not aggressive and he's a bit shy but once you get to know him, you'll love him. Please, someone, adopt this poor dog before it ends up on someone's plate. Call me or text me at- for more information. I am giving away this pet, not selling it. As long as the new owner loves this dog, and would be able to take good care of it, I'm happy.",8f2b809a0,1.0,0,8f2b809a0-1

He gets along well with other non aggressive dogs as well as children. He's potty trained but accidents still happen sometimes. He also has a recurring ear infection on his left ear that needs to be monitored from time to time. Overall, he's an awesome little dog and we would've happily take him with us if its not so expensive and complicated. So we're hoping instead to find him a good home. Interested candidates will be interviewed and interrogated for bootsy's wellbeing. Note: Thank you all for your interest and for taking the time to see him. The choice was difficult to make but we decided to go with the most suitable candidate. We believe that he would have a good life with his new family.",bbe1feff9,5.0,0,bbe1feff9-5

My previous owner said he can't afford to keep me anymore and let me wandered off into the lonely and unfamiliar streets by myself. I couldn't understand since when my love and loyalty wasn't worth the kibbles and daily evening walks anymore. I was rescued off the streets by a few humans with really kind voices and I tried to put on my best winning smiles. We went to the vet and he was happy with my health condition, with slight issue with my back leg (comes with age, but I walk fine). I have been neutered and my tail is docked. My previous owner has been contacted and has agreed to hand over my MKA certification & vaccination cards. I'm so excited and ready for my next chapter in life, and I hope you could help me too. I'm urgently looking for a new owner whom I could play with, someone who would understand that it might take some time to get to know me better, someone who will not give up on me, someone who is patient, has basic knowledge with dogs with trust issue, and most of all, someone I can love with the rest of my life. My previous owner named me 'Trigger', but I promise I'm a gentle giant who has a lot more to offer. They told me if I couldn't find an owner in time, I would be put to sleep. I didn't what that means, but they said it with a really sad face. So please, help me find a forever home.

He has bipolar eyes (blue and brown), a common feature in Siberian Huskies. I am very saddened to put him up for adoption because I will be going to Australia to work for long term. Therefore, I'm looking for responsible and pet loving owners to adopt him. Rex knows all basic commands sit, stay, down, No, good boy etc. and is very gentle towards people. Unfortunately, he goes slightly wild when he sees a cat or a female dog. He has not been spayed because I never believed in removing the manhood of an animal for our own comfort. With proper training and discipline, he will know its boundaries. However, because I have been his master all his life, there is a possibility that he will be stubborn towards its new owners. But every living being with a conscience that moves to a new environment will slowly adapt, he needs to know who his new master is and that is where you slowly and gradually train him to understand you. It takes time. My journey and time with rex has been one that is full of joy and I will miss playing and bringing him for walks.

She's been living around Pusat Bandar Damansara for over seven months & because the building, in which all the stray cats in the area live in is soon to be demolished, she no longer has a place to stay. So now she stays around the HELP Residence and Management is planning to take her away where she will be put to sleep. It seems as though she had an accident because her right eye is damaged. But she is a sweet & loving cat (oh, and she LOVES cuddling!). We have a week to find her a decent home where she could be loved and cared for, She deserves it. Unfortunately as we are students living in university accommodation, we cannot take her in. No adoption fees are charged, we just really need her to be safe & have the love and care she's never had. Please contact me if you are willing to take her in or Share this post if you know anyone who would be interested. Thank you! :) PS: We do believe that she has been neutered, as she has the snip in her ear that vets generally use on catch and release strays who have been brought in for neutering, to avoid being brought in again by a different person.",8ec8828d8,3.0,0,8ec8828d8-3
