## Objective
Create an app to recommend animals (cats and dogs). This system will always recommend the ten pets which low probability of adoption.<br>
The idea here is to make partnetship with ONGs, but for now, was developed only a prototype of the system using a Kaggle dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction">PetFinder.my Adoption Prediction</a>.

## Motivation
There are 170 thousand of abandoned animals under ONGs care in Brazil, and a lot of people only adopt looking for the appearence.<br>
The proposal here is to suggest animal that in most part of times are not even looked.<br>

## Process
1. Create a baseline to find the best model;
2. Use pipeline to create the final model;
3. Filter the dataset to create the search from user;
4. Order the results by percentage;
5. Create the app using streamlit.


## Results 
You can check the slides <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4Yz2EtTEtVsi5UT_zQWrkVkfXpbvsAm/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

## Learning Process
### Theory Applied
- [x] Pandas <br>
- [x] Numpy<br>
- [x] Target Encoder<br>
- [x] Standard Scaler<br>
- [x] Logistic Regression<br>
- [x] ROC Score <br>
- [x] YellowBrick<br>
- [x] Decision Tree Classifier<br>
- [x] Pipelines<br>
- [x] JobLib<br>
- [x] Streamlit<br>


### Challenges
- Find a good model to predict the probabilities;

### Improvements
- Load the site into Heroku;
- Build a dataset using data from a Brazilian ONG;
- Improve streamlit design;
- Implement a search by image;

### Thanks
A special thanks for the IronHack teachers, who helped me a lot during the development of project.<br>
